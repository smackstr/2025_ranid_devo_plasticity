# Data Cleaning, Manipulation, and Analysis associated with Strobel, S. M., Fischer, E. K., & Womack, M. C. (2025). Consequences of developmental and growth-rate plasticity within and across life stages in wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). Royal Society Open Science, 12(5), 250202.

## What this project does
This project analyzes experimental data to assess how rearing population density and larval development time interact to influence morphology and survivorship during the tadpole stage, at metamorphosis, and up to 8 months after metamorphosis.

The project uses the following approach:
- cleaning and joining of twelve databases using base R and tidyverse
- generalized linear mixed models
- linear mixed models
- model comparison and selection using AICc and log-likelihood
- visualization using ggplot2

This project includes all the code and datasets associated with a peer-reviewed scientific publication.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
Sarah McKay Strobel is the sole database manager and contributor to this project
